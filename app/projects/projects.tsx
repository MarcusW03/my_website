      date: "June 2024 - Present",
      details: "Conducted research for the NSF REU Site for Pervasive Computing at Temple University, within the Vision, Imaging, \
               and Data Analysis Research (VIDAR) Lab under Dr. Richard Souvenir's mentorship. \
              \n\n Focused on evaluating AI explanations, analyzing their impact on improving human interaction and decision-making \
               with AI systems. Gained experience with Human-Computer Interaction, and Explainable AI (xAI) systems. \
              \n\n Integrated AI explanation methods into a Deep Similarity Machine Learning Model and added to a web-based \
               frontend to facilitate participant interaction with the AI explanations. Conducted a user study with modified frontend.",

      date: "October 2024 - December 2024",
      details: "Designed and implemented advanced imputation strategies \
              (mean/mode, predictive modeling, hybrid approach),  \
              handled outliers, and applied feature scaling to optimize model inputs. \
              \n\n Reduced multicollinearity through \
              correlation analysis, transformed cyclical variables with sine-cosine encoding, and mapped spatial \
              data using latitude-longitude to enhance model interpretability. \
              \n\n Evaluated multiple preprocessing pipelines \
              across KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests,  using statistical validation (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis) \
              to assess their effect on predictive accuracy (~84-85%)",
